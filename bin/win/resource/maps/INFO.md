# Tilemap Customization Information.

Tilemaps are customizable via their respective files in `resource/maps/.

---------------

## Layout

\<name\>(_Data).json -- See Application::Application()

The _Data file is generated by Tiled. Do not modify this file other than with Tiled itself. (https://thorbjorn.itch.io/tiled)

The \<name\>.json file is for customization -- an example file would look like this:
```json
{
	"defaults": {
		...tile data here...
	},
	"tiles": {
		"0": {
			...individual tile data here...
		}
	}
}
```
* "defaults"
	* The standard tile configuration when there are no customization options specified.

* "tiles"
	* The individual tile configuration. Each json object is labeled with the tile's ID, and the inside contents are the same as all other tile configurations (including "defaults")
