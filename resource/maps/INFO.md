# Tilemap Customization Information.

Tilemaps are customizable via their respective files in `resource/maps/`.

---------------

## Layout

\<name\>(_Data).json -- Generated by Tiled

Do not modify this file other than with Tiled itself. (https://thorbjorn.itch.io/tiled)

The \<name\>.json file is for customization -- an example file would look like this:
```json
{
	"defaults": {
		...tile data here...
	},
	"tiles": {
		"0": {
			...individual tile data here...
		}
	}
}
```
* "defaults"
	* The standard tile configuration when there are no customization options specified.

* "tiles"
	* The individual tile configuration. Each json object is labeled with the tile's ID, and the inside contents are the same as all other tile configurations (including "defaults")
	
## Tiledata.

For now, all tiles simply are assigned a name.

Ex:
```json
{
	"defaults": {
		"name": "Air"
	},
	"tiles": {
		"1": {
			"name": "Grass"
		},
		"2": {
			"name": "Water"
		},
		"3": {
			"name": "Tree"
		},
		"4": {
			"name": "Stone"
		}
	}
}
```
This assigns the tile IDs with their name. All tiles not specified (I.E. Tile ID 0 -- Air) are given the default values, in this case "Air".
